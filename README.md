# SQL-Based-Analytical-Warehouse-System

An end-to-end SQL Data Warehouse project that transforms raw business data into structured analytical data for decision-making.

This project demonstrates real-world data engineering concepts such as ETL processing, layered architecture, dimensional modeling, and analytical querying using SQL.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a complete data warehouse system that converts unstructured operational data into meaningful business insights.

Key goals:
- Data warehouse architecture
- Implement ETL using SQL
- Clean and standardize raw datasets
- Build fact and dimension tables
- Generate analytical reports for decision making

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The warehouse follows a **multi-layer architecture**:

### 1️⃣ Raw Layer (Bronze)
- Stores source data without modification
- Acts as historical backup
- Used for traceability

### 2️⃣ Processed Layer (Silver)
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Handles null values, duplicates, formatting
- Standardizes columns and data types

### 3️⃣ Analytics Layer (Gold)
- Optimized for reporting
- Fact and Dimension tables created
- Ready for business intelligence queries

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL / SQL Server / PostgreSQL)
- Data Modeling
- ETL Techniques
- Relational Database Concepts

---

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. Import raw CSV datasets into database
2. Clean and transform the data
3. Create relational schema
4. Build fact and dimension tables
5. Perform analytical queries
6. Generate business insights

---

## 📊 Example Insights
- Top selling products
- Monthly revenue trends
- Customer purchasing patterns
- Category performance analysis
- Sales contribution by region

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning using SQL
- Joins and Aggregations
- Window Functions
- CTEs and Subqueries
- Dimensional Modeling (Star Schema)
- Analytical Query Writing

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
This project was built as a hands-on learning exercise to understand practical data engineering workflows and strengthen SQL skills required for data analytics and data engineering roles.

---

## 📌 Note
Inspired by learning resources from the **DataWithBaraa** YouTube channel.  
The implementation, structure, and documentation were written independently for educational purposes.
